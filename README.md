## 💼 Projects

### 🏠 HomeShare — Roomate and Sublet Website  
A full-stack web app that helps users find and post housing listings with roommate preferences. 
Built with a focus on user authentication, role-based access, and modular architecture.

- 🔐 **Authentication:** JWT-based login/signup system with session persistence
- 📦 **Backend:** Node.js + Express with protected routes and RESTful API (`/api/House`)
- 🧠 **Frontend:** React with context-based state management (AuthContext, HouseContext)
- 🗃️ **Features:**  
  - Upload listings with multiple images
  - Date-range availability  
  - User-specific actions (delete/edit only your own posts)  
- 📂 Modular, scalable, and includes hooks like `useAuthContext`, `useHouseContext`, and `useLogin`
- 🧪 Custom error handling, form validation, and UI feedback via React

> 💡 This project highlights a strong grasp of full-stack development, secure API design, and modern React architecture.


### 🧠 Deep Learning — Latent Representation Learning  
Explored self-supervised, supervised, and contrastive learning on **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**.  
- Built autoencoders, classifiers, and SimCLR-style encoders from scratch.  
- Used PyTorch with early stopping, t-SNE visualization, and evaluation pipelines.  
- Results: Achieved 99.37% accuracy on MNIST and 82.27% on CIFAR-10 (classification-guided).
